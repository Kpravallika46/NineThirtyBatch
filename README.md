1Q) what is the history of python?
Created by Guido van Rossum (1989–1991) at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands.
It included important features like functions, exceptions, and core data types (str, list, dict, etc.)
Python 3 dominates, widely used in AI, data science, web, and automation.

2Q) what is the open sources and close source in phython?
open source:
Open Source means Python’s source code is freely available to everyone.
Examples:YouTube ,instagram,spotify.
close source:
Closed Source means the source code is not available to the public.
Only the owner/company can access, modify, and distribute the code.
Example:neflix

3Q) What is compilation?
Compilation is the process of translating source code (written in a high-level programming language) into machine code (binary) that a computer can directly execute.
Advantage: Faster execution, error checking at compile-time, optimized performance.
Disadvantage: Compilation takes extra time before execution and compiled code is less portable.

4Q) what is web application?
Web applications are software programs that run on a web server and are accessed through a web browser using the internet.
Main use:
* Communication
* Social networking
* Online shopping
* Education
* Entertainment
* Productivity tools

Famous web appilications
* Gmail – email communication.
* Facebook – social networking.
* YouTube – video sharing/entertainment.
* Amazon – e-commerce shopping
* Google Docs – online document editing
* LinkedIn – professional networking.

5Q) What is features of phython?
Python is a high-level, interpreted, object-oriented, and open-source programming language that is easy to learn and widely used for web development, data science, AI, automation, and more.
Main Features of Python
* Simple & Easy to Learn – Syntax is close to English, beginner-friendly.
* Interpreted Language – Executes code line by line (no separate compilation).
* High-Level Language – No need to manage memory or hardware details.
* Dynamically Typed – No need to declare variable types (Python decides automatically).
* Object-Oriented – Supports classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism.
